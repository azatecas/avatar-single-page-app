## Welcome to my Avatar: The last airbender character's fanpage

## This project utilizes:
    -- React Js
    -- React Router
    -- Axios
    -- Styled-Components
    -- Particle.JS

This entire Project wouldn't be possible without [paigeegorry's](https://github.com/paigeegorry?tab=overview&from=2019-12-01&to=2019-12-31) excelent Avatar:TLA API.
It appears to be the only API for this particular series and as soon as i noticed it, I knew i had to do something with it.

Currently, the Homepage display's the Appa character flying at night with a paralaxing background.
Characters Page renders and can search all characters from The Avatar series including The Legend of Korra and Comicbook characters. 

I am implementing an Episodes Page with all episodes from both series. Because I do not own the API I will be creating the JSON Data for the episodes and adding it as a Component.

This page will continue to be a work in progress. The only functionality for now is displaying all characters from the API and the ability to search through them by name. I added a simple CSS animation to make motion more noticeble
